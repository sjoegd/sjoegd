### Hi there I'm SjoegdðŸ‘‹
#### I'm interested in IT development and working on something related to it daily.

I'm currently studying Computer Science and learning related topics asides.
So far, the languages i've accumulated knowledge about Java, Python, C, C++, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Haskell.
I also have a lot of experience with topics like Game Development, Data Science, AI (RL, NEAT etc.), MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS), Minecraft Plugin Development (PaperMC and Waterfall) and a lot more.

I strive to learn new skills every single day and work on
projects and learning new languages, libraries or skills almost daily.
